										<h3>Early Life</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I was born in April 1998 in San Jose, California. When I turned 5, we moved to Atlanta, Georgia which is where I was raised. 
										I went to Lambert High School and after seeing my younger brother watch Java programming tutorials on Youtube at home one day, 
										I decided that I would try and take AP Computer Science, which was the only Computer Science class that they offered. 
										I did terrible on the AP exam, which blew a big hole into the my confidence. However, I knew that I loved Computer Science and 
										programming, and I discovered that the structure and logic-based thinking and problem-solving was something that I could not stop thinking about.</p>

										<h3>Education</h3>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/uga.png" alt="uga" /></span>I graduated Lambert High School in 2016 and found that going to the University of North Georgia was what I wanted to do. I had heard great things about their Computer Science program, and during my two years there I had to agree, it was a wonderful program with driven students and a passionate staff of professors.
										However, my ultimate dream since high school was to study and graduate at the Univeristy of Georgia, so in 2018 I was successfully transferred to my dream university. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree in December of 2020, but as any seasoned programmer knows, just because you finished school
										does not mean the learning is over!

										<h3>My Career</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Since high school, I knew that programming, no matter how tough it can be, was what I wanted to do for a career. I knew that I wanted to develop software that was
										easy to use, simple to navigate, useful to others. After graduating from UGA, I was lucky enough to find myself at <strong><i><a href="https://www.talentpath.com/">Talent Path</a></i></strong>, 
										a wonderful company with an incredible mission to bridge the gap between the academic world and professional world of software development. I then recieved a 6 month contract at Dell Technologies, serving
										as a full stack engineer in an organization called Consumer Modernization (COSMOS) where I eventually got brought on as a full-time employee. I am still currently with Dell Technologies on the same team, 
										helping to implement front and back end features.
